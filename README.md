# English-Greek Dictionary

A Vocabulary of the Attic Language by S. C. WOODHOUSE, M.A.

* `orig-data/woodhouse.csv` from <https://github.com/dcthree/woodhouse> (for which see provenance)

* `data/woodhouse.txt` programmatically processed version of csv with vowel length handled via Unicode rather than colour and other colours converted to more semantic tags. Minor (automated) corrections alongt the way but still lots to do
